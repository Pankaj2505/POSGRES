- challange 
	> from available data set which entity is fact and which entity is dimesion 

- Example 
	retail data set [date , store , product, quantity , unit price, sales amount , transaction no, saletax, product in hand]
	
	1. first check how many entities are text and number
		- text[date , store , product]
		- Number [ quantity , unit price, sales amount , transaction no,saletax, product in hand]
		
	2. Fact - in general [any numeric entity which is measurable]  
		- for example quantity , unit price, sales amount . they all are measurable.
		- if you write fact as number , they are meaning less, you will not know what this no is.
		- it provide quantitative information about business like total sale in an year.
		- we should ask question like , what is total no of product sold for product A ?
		- Not all numeric values are Fact, for example Transaction no is numeric but its a degenerated dimensions.
	
	3. Dimension - [dimensions are those entities which explain about facts.
		- for example [date , store , product] 
		- dimensions are explaining these features[ what, time, geography,product]
		- These are descriptive entities.
		- __some time we define number values are dimensions also called degenerated dimensions__		
		- example 
			- people [customer, vendors, patient , providers]
			- product [eatable, machinery, eductaional]
			- place [country, continent , city , street, landmark,house no]
			- time [year, month, day, hours ,minute, second]

- Challange
	> how to categorise fact, not all numeric entities can be aggregated
	
		- Type of facts [ we use aggregation or summation to divide facts]
			- Additive facts
				- if a fact can be summed up for all the dimesion of a table is called Additive fact 
				- for example sales amount [find total sales happend in delhi store][ total sale on a date][total sale of product A]
			- Semi Additive fact 
				- if fact can be added for few dimensions 
				- 
				- like quatitiy in hand after a sale, we can not add it for date,  total 
			- Non Additive facts
				- for example unit price, [find unit price for product A][ now find unit price based on delhi store , here we can not summed up]
				- for example  percentage , ration
			
- Challange 
	> How to design a fact table 
	
	- 	Fact table
		1. it store quantitative entity for analysis
		2. often denormalize
		3. fact table are often defined by there grain(are we storing info on country level, city level or daily commodities]
		
			- steps to create fact table 
				1. find all business metric [quantity , unit price, sales amount, saletax, quantity in hand]they will be columns of fact table
				2. set of foreign key [realtionshio key with dimension table  ]
				3. primary key [ PK for fact table made by composite of all foreign key  ] 
				4. these FK are Surrogate key from dimension table 
				5. we add degenrated dimension also as fact table columns
		4. Surrogate Key 
			1. What is Surrogate Key( also known as surrogate key , fact-less key , technical key )	
				- each dimension table will have PK associated with each transaction.
				- now lets say we have SCD(slowly changing dimension)[Employee Role] , if we need to keep track of all role of an employee, this will make PK as duplicate.
				- now lets say we have trnasaction coming from multiple sources , and they have other way to store unique key.[source 1: S501, source2:st501] here PK for dimesnion table is not in same format.
				- so these natural key are not in contril of datawarhouse system.
				- so along with NK , we create one more key , which is unique and related to dimension table ,this key is called Surrogate key .
				- fact table will store dimension table SK as FK in fact table 
			
	> Types of fact table
		- Transaction fact table 
		- Peridic snapshot fact table 
		- Accumulating fact table
	 1. Types of fact table depends on 
		- Grain: which level of information we are storing in fact table .
			- for example - 
				1. Storing only product name information in fact table.
				2. Storing prduct name and store information .
				3. Storing product name , store , and manufactoring date in fact table 
			- so the level at which we store the measurement in fact table is called grain.
			- grain answers what is the lowset level of information stored in fact table.
				- one row per product 
				- one row per product ,per store
				- one row per product , per store , per date.
			- grain should be defined before creating a schema.
			- grain must be declared before choosing dimesion and fact. what does this mean ?
				- let say we decide we will keep fact with lowest information of [date, hours, store, product, customer] so we must have below dimension 
					- date [day, month, year, century , hours, min, second] --> date dimension must hold hour also .
					- in case date contain hours support, but fact table does not keep hours , and reporting needs hours information, then its complicated to modify the structure od fact table.
					- we must keep dimension for store, product and customer.
			- __Keep lowest possible grain in fact table__
		
		- summation ability of a fact.
				
	2. Transaction fact table 
		- definition : it store lowset grain of data. 
		- grain : one row per transaction 
		- dimension : date dimesnion at lowest level
		- aggregation: easy as mostly are additive facts
		- database size : largest 
		- update : not needed
		- best use case: most business requirement for aggragation of data
		
		
	3. Periodic snapshot fact table
		- definition : it store the current state of data at regular interval of time. used in inventory mostly. for example : keep availble bed.
		- grain : one row per time period
		- dimension : date/time is regular interval of snapshot history . we take each row from transaction fact table and keep its value for each time instance in another fact table.
		- aggregation: minimal aggregation
		- database size : smaller than transaction 
		- update : not needed
		- best use case: when data needed for regular time interval
		
	4. Accumulating fact table
	
		- definition : store "intermediate step" that happend over period of time . mostly for process flow management . for example keep all approval date along hirerachy.
		- grain : one row entire lifetime
		- dimension: multiple date dimension for intermediate step for example : know when a product got manufactored , moved, sold, expired.
		- aggregation: not easy as trnascation fact table
		- database size - smallest
		- update: update one process moves from one level to another
		- best use case: when process has multiple stages.
