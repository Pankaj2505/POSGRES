### Topic To Cover 
	1. Joins – show you a brief overview of joins in PostgreSQL.
	
	2. Inner Join – select rows from one table that has the corresponding rows in other tables.
	3. Left Join – select rows from one table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables.
	4. Self-join – join a table to itself by comparing a table to itself.
	5. Full Outer Join – use the full join to find a row in a table that does not have a matching row in another table.
	6. Cross Join – produce a Cartesian product of the rows in two or more tables.
	7. Natural Join – join two or more tables using implicit join condition based on the common column names in the joined tables.
	
	
#### Join

	- fetch common in both 
		- select * from a join b on a.key = b.key;
	- fetch not common in both 
		- select * from a full join b on a.key = b.key where a.key is null or b.key is null;
	- fetch all left with common 
	- fetch all left with out common 
		- select * from a left join b on a.key = b.key where  b.key is null;
	- fetch all right with common 
	- fetch all left with out common 
		- select * from a right join b on a.key = b.key where a.key is null;
	- fetch every thing 
		- select * from a full join b on a.key = b.key ;

#### Inner Join
	1. The inner join examines each row in the first table (basket_a).
	2. It compares the value in the fruit_a column with the value in the fruit_b column of each row in the second table (basket_b).
	3. If these values are equal, the inner join creates a new row that contains all columns of both tables and adds it to the result set.
	4. In case these values are not equal, the inner join just ignores them and moves to the next row.
	5. value = null will be treat as false
	6. null = value will be treat as false
	7. null = null will be treat as false
	```
		SELECT
			a,
			fruit_a,
			b,
			fruit_b
		FROM
			basket_a
		INNER JOIN basket_b
			ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
	```
	
	- Join three table 
	```
		SELECT
			c.customer_id,
			c.first_name customer_first_name,
			c.last_name customer_last_name,
			s.first_name staff_first_name,
			s.last_name staff_last_name,
			amount,
			payment_date
		FROM
			customer c
		INNER JOIN payment p 
			ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
		INNER JOIN staff s 
			ON p.staff_id = s.staff_id
		ORDER BY payment_date;
	```
	
#### Left JOIN
	1. The LEFT JOIN clause starts selecting data from the left table.
	2.  For each row in the left table, it compares the value in the pka column with the value of each row in the fka column in the right table.

	3. If these values are equal, the left join clause creates a new row .
	4. In case these values are not equal, the left join clause also creates a new row with left table column , and right table column as null.
	
	5. left value = right value will be treated as true, create a new row
	6. left value <> right value will be treated as true, but row is created having left table col with right table column as null
	7. value = null will be treat as false, no row created 
	8. null = value will be treat as true , row created with left table column will be selected with right table column as null
	9. null = null will be treat as false, no row created 
	
	
#### Right JOIN
	1. The Right JOIN clause starts selecting data from the Right table.
	2.  For each row in the Right table, it compares the value in the pka column with the value of each row in the fka column in the Left table.

	3. If these values are equal, the Right join clause creates a new row .
	4. In case these values are not equal, the Right join clause also creates a new row with Right table column , and Left table column as null.
	
	5. right value = left value will be treated as true, create a new row
	6. right value <> left value will be treated as true, row is created having Right table col with Left table column as null
	7. value = null will be treat as false, row created with Right table column will be selected with Left table column as null
	8. null = value will be treat as true , no row created 
	9. null = null will be treat as false, no row created 
	
	
#### full outer JOIN
	
	|t1_col1 | t1.age| t2.col1|t2.age|
	|--------|-------|--------|------|
	|	1	 |	15	 |	1	  |	15	 |
	|	1	 |	16	 |  null  | null |
	|	1	 | null  |	null  | null |		
	|	1	 | 17	 |	null  |	null |
	|	1	 |	null | null	  |	null |
	
#### Cross Join
	- If T1 has n rows and T2 has m rows, the result set will have nxm rows.

	|t1_col1 | t1.age| t2.col1|t2.age|
	|--------|-------|--------|------|
	|	1	|	15	|	1	|	17	|
	|	1	|	15	|		|	1	|
	|	1	|	16	|	1	|	15	|
	|	1	|	16	|	1	|	17	|
	|	1	|	16	|	1	|		|
	|	1	|		|	1	|	15	|
	|	1	|		|	1	|	17	|
	|	1	|		|	1	|		|
	

#### Self-join
	1. On heirarical data (on other column)
	```
		SELECT
			e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name employee,
			m .first_name || ' ' || m .last_name manager
		FROM
			employee e
		LEFT JOIN employee m ON m .employee_id = e.manager_id
		ORDER BY manager;
	```
	2. On Same column
	```
		SELECT
			f1.title,
			f2.title,
			f1.length
		FROM
			film f1
		INNER JOIN film f2 
			ON f1.film_id <> f2.film_id AND 
			   f1.length = f2.length;
	```
	
#### Natural JOIN
	- it is same as join clause
	- it uses the common column from two table implicitly 
	- if two table has more than one common column then result set is empty
	
#### Code 
```
	if exist drop table table1;
	create table table1(
		col1 int,
		age int) ;
		
	if exist drop table table2;
	create table table2(
		col1 int,
		age int) ;	
		
	insert into table1(col1, age) values (1, 15);	
	insert into table1(col1, age) values (1, 16);
	insert into table1(col1, age) values (1, null);

		
	insert into table2(col1, age) values (1, 15);
	insert into table2(col1, age) values (1, 17);
	insert into table2(col1, age) values (1, null);

	select * from table1;
	select * from table2;

	select 
		t1.col1,
		t1.age,
		t2.col1,
		t2.age
	from table1 t1 inner join table2 t2
	on t1.age =t2.age;

	select 
		t1.col1,
		t1.age,
		t2.col1,
		t2.age
	from table1 t1 left join table2 t2
	on t1.age =t2.age;


	select 
		t1.col1,
		t1.age,
		t2.col1,
		t2.age
	from table1 t1 right join table2 t2
	on t1.age =t2.age;


	select 
		t1.col1,
		t1.age,
		t2.col1,
		t2.age
	from table1 t1 full outer join table2 t2
	on t1.age =t2.age;






	-- fetch common in both 
		select 
			t1.col1,
			t1.age,
			t2.col1,
			t2.age
		from table1 t1  join table2 t2
		on t1.age =t2.age;
	-- fetch not common in both 
		select 
			t1.col1,
			t1.age,
			t2.col1,
			t2.age
		from table1 t1  full join table2 t2
		on t1.age =t2.age
		where t1.age is null or t2.age is null;
			- select * from a join b on a.key = b.key where a.key is null or b.key is null
		- fetch all left with common 
		- fetch all left with out common 
		- fetch all right with common 
		- fetch all left with out common
